# unit-4-game

This is a game that requires the player to choose from three different crystals. Each crystal has a different value, which you will NOT know and will change with each round. You will be attempting to match the random number.

To win, you will need to match the random number exactly. Otherwise, you will lose.

As a reminder: each crystal has a different value, to win you match the random number, each game the crystal values will change.

Only the strong survive.
